Data file(s):
1. D_s_SCD1_L.csv: Labeled data for part 1
2. D_u_SCD1_L.csv: Unlabeled data for part 1
3. D_s_SCD1.csv: Labeled data for part 2
4. D_u_SCD1.csv: Unlabeled data for part 2

Jupyter notebooks:
1. Multi-View_Training_for_Chemical_Activity_Classification-P1.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the implementation and results for Part-1 of the project which uses the original labeled and unlabeled datsets. The data will be automatically read after running all cells.
2. Multi-View_Training_for_Chemical_Activity_Classification-P2.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the implementation and results for Part-2 of the project which uses a part of the labeled data to simulate unlabeled data. The data will be automatically read after running all cells.
