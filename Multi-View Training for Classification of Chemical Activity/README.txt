This folder contains implementation of a Semi-Supervised Multiview training algorithm using a K Nearest Neighbor for the SCD1 receptor data. The motive behind using a semi-supervised approach on this dataset is to compansate for the low number of labeled datapoints which generally isn't enough to train a robust classification/regression model. Using the vast amount of unlabeled dataset from CHEMBL as well as the relelively small labeled dataset for SCD1, the semi-supervised learning algorithm implemented here aims to train a more robust model.
